       <div class="rectangle" id="database">
           <h1 class="projectTitle">Electric Load Configuration Database</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p class="p2">There is no central system to effectively manage loads. Furthermore, loads are related to various items including drawings, locations, and even panels and there needs to be a better way to show all these relationships.</p class="p2">
           
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p class="p2">For this problem, we chose the most common type of database, a relational database. 
                This allows one to create connections between categories of information that are related.
                For example, a one-to-one relation might show up as one cable type to one load.
                A one-to-many relation might look like one load connected to many drawings. 
                And a many-to-many relation would look like many drawings tied to many loads. 
            </p class="p2">

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p class="p2">So, why did we choose a <a href="Images/database copy.PNG" target="_blank" class="smallLink">relational</a> database to solve these issues?
                Well, first, databases allow you to organize and sort data. 
                Second, a database makes it easy to find data.
                Last, a database provides the ability to program and manipulate this data.

        <div class="rectangle" id="voltageDrop">
            <h1 class="projectTitle">Branch Circuit Voltage Drop Calculator</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p class="p2">The problem in this case is that the American Bureau of Shipping requires calculations for voltage drop across cable lengths. Also,  this is a requirement for a power flow study. </p class="p2">
           
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p class="p2">To solve this problem we use a Y matrix, an NxN matrix describing a power system.
                Essentially, a measure of how easily a circuit or device will allow current to flow.
                This simple circuit can be represented as a matrix and solved numerically.

            </p class="p2">

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p class="p2">The solving technique can be extended to model loads as constant power or constant impedance loads as well.
                Voltage drop gets worse as you get further down circuit.
                There is not a large change in degrees because higher resistance than reactance (transmission line) = bigger difference in angle than magnitude.

         <div class="rectangle" id="panelTool">
            <h1 class="projectTitle">Three-phase Panel Balancer</h1>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p class="p2">We have three phases of power on a ship and loads need to be balanced across those three phases. If loads are not balanced across the phases it will damage the generator through overheating. </p class="p2">
           
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p class="p2">In order to balance the loads across phases, we modeled a three-phase power panel in Microsoft Excel. We chose a genetic algorithm because the variables are discrete, meaning they take on a single value, and Excel has a built-in implementation.
            </p class="p2">

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p class="p2"> 
                    In order to perform the genetic algorithm, we need to create a DNA (series of discrete variables). Unbalances in three-phase generator loading cause negative sequence current. The generator leads are exposed to intense heating as a result of the negative sequence current subjecting the generator rotor to damage. We use the panel solver to optimize load layout and minimize the negative sequence current.
